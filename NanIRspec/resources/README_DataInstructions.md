The Bacteria subtilis data sets have the following constraints /groupings:

1) Measurements in May (all on treated bacteria only):
Two data showing the same position:
1a) 2105_BacVan30_989-1349cm-1 
1b) 2105_BacVan15_1490-1659cm-1 
A further data set on shorter incubation (less interaction)
1c) 2105_BacVan30_989-1349cm-1 

2) Measurements in July: 
Only 30 min incubation. Both on treated and control bacteria:
2a) 2107_Control30_1351-1659cm-1 
2b) 2107_BacVan30_1351-1659cm-1 

3) Measurements in August. 
All at spectral range of 1400-1659 cm-1 (different range than in the other dates!). Three pairs of treated and control bacteria, having 15, 30 and 60 min incubation. The control group for 15 min might have had some issue with preparation. 
The 15 min incubation control has a shorter spectral range!!!!
This time, the instrument was set for optimizing the detection frequency the calibrate for variations of mechanical sample properties 

3a)2108_BacVan30_1400-1659cm-1 
3b) 2108_Control30_1400-1659cm-1 
3c)  2108_BacVan60_1400-1659cm-1
3d) 2108_Control60_1400-1659cm-1 
3e) 2108_BacVan15_1400-1659cm-1
3f) 2108_Control15_1500-1659cm-1

4) Two hyperspectral data sets of a the peptide D-Ala-D-Ala incubated 30 min with Vancomycin. Probably also on the same position.
4a) 2104_DalVan_989-1349cm-1 - CaF2 file for calibration available
4b) 2104_DalVan_1351-1659cm-1- CaF2 file for calibration available


Ideas for combined analysis: 
- Analyse 1a and 1b together and see if interactions can be found in both bands (drop at 1280 cm-1 and rise around 1520 cm-1) and locally mapped 
- Analyse 1a and 1c together and see whether similar spectral components can be found
- Analyse 2a and 2b together. Interaction bands should not be found in control group but only in treated group
- Analyse 3a and 3b together and 3c and 3d.
- Analyse 3a-e) together 3f has a shorter spectra range!!!!
- Analyse 1b), 2a) and 3a together (All three 30 min incubation and treated; however, all have slightly different spectral ranges!!!!!
- Analyse 1b,c) 2a,b 3a,b) (all six 30 min incubation scans) together

- Analyze 4a) and 4b) together and see if interactions can be found in both bands (1280 cm-1 and 1520 cm-1) and locally mapped
