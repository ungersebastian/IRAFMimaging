It aims at developing tools for processing spectral data from vibrational nanospectroscopy methods, 
and conventional FTIR and Raman-spectroscopy for comparison.

So far experimental methods have been:
- photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM)
- FTIR
- Raman-spectroscopy
- optical photo-thermal induced resonance (O-PTIR)

Subtopics are sorted in folders:
- NanIRim: processing and comparing scan images (mainly PiFM)
- NanIRspec: analysis of PiFM hyperspectral data 
- SpecTools: basic tools for background subtraction etc.
