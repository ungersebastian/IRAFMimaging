It aims at developing tools for processing spectral data from vibrational nanospectroscopy methods, 
and conventional FTIR (and Raman spectroscopy) for comparison.

So far experimental methods have been:
- photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM)
- FTIR
- Raman spectroscopy
- optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (O-PTIR)

Subtopics are sorted in folders:
1. NanIRim: processing and comparing scan images (mainly PiFM)
2. NanIRspec: processing and analyzing spectral data:  
-  _hyPIRana_: analysis of PiFM hyperspectral data (callibration, mean spectra, PCA) 
-  _monIRana_: analysis of already callibrated single spectra (mean spectra, PCA)
3. SpecTools: basic tools for background subtraction etc.
